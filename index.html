    <u>Description:</u>
    <h2>
        In our game/website it would lead our players in a storyline where the players can interact with a character that they have created/chosen. From the storyline they will learn from their mistakes that ended their journey and try again in order to reach the end of the storyline. From the story, the player should learn how A.I. could impact the world (Using evidence we have gathered in our assignment #3) and whether it is beneficial or not. Please enjoy.
